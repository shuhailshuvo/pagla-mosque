      "The origins of Pagla Mosque are steeped in legend. One tale speaks of Dewan Zilkadar Khan, a spiritual figure and descendant of Isa Khan, who is said to have floated on a mat along the Narsunda River to the mosque's current location. Another story attributes the mosque's founding to a childless woman from the Haibatnagar zamindar family, known as 'Pagla Bibi' who, inspired by a dream, established the mosque. These narratives contribute to the mosque's reputation as a place where sincere prayers and donations are believed to bring blessings and fulfill wishes ",

    title: "Key Historical Timeline",
    description:
      `According to local legends and oral history, the mosque was first built over 70 years ago, possibly in the 1940s or early 1950s.

It has since been renovated and expanded multiple times, with the current structure being much more modern in design and scale.

It came under the management of the State Waqf Administration in 1979, which helped formalize its operation and expand its community role.

The origins are closely tied to local folklore, particularly involving a saintly figure named Dewan Zilkadar Khan or a woman known as Pagla Bibi, adding a spiritual mystique to its foundation rather than a clear architectural record.`,
